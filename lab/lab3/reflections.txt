1) 

2) Makes the constructor general purpose, can handle both files and
keyboard inputs.

3) Depending on the definition of process, we processed the file by looking
for tags and special characters over the whole file at once. However, in the constructor,
we imported line for line to generate the string, representing the whole file.

4) Yes, by using for example .str() member function.

5) No

6) By using stream_name.good(), which returns true or false.

7) stream_name.eof(), which returns a boolean.

8) Our version returns 123. To implement exception handling, we would need to
move away from the template function and implement operator>> error throwing,
but in the example for <int>, no error was thrown, so an exception has to
be implemented inside the template class.

9) Depends if the template type is the return value or the argument.
The intent decides. In the second case, we need to know the return value,
and should therefore be specified as a type argument in the call.
