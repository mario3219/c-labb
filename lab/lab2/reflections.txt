1) std::cin >> s as a bool value will return true as long as the stream is "open" meaning there could be more to read. Typically exited using a keyboard
command like ctrl+D

2) No, we used "getline()". If we were to use the ">>" operator instead, we would need to specify the txt file as our input stream outside the class when
running the executable, such as in the makefile. (see lab3) 

3) An array of type int, with 10 indexes

4) Because when comparing an unsigned value to a signed value, the compiler converts the signed value to unsigned. This will create errors for example
in the case of comparing -1 to 1. (-1 converts to 1)

5) In the case of using resize(5) on an empty string vector, 5 ("") elements will be added to the vector using the default string constructor. However,
another value than "" may be specified in the resize function call, e.g. 'resize(5,"hej")'
